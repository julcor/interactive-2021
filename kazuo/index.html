	Language is superseded by form—is fixed. Form is superseded by reality—is concretized. Reality is negated in language—style. Language is systematized.

	<h1>Hot Meaning</h1>
	<h2>First Style</h2>
	<h2>1954-1968</h2>
	<p>	
	The atypical projects make use of Japanese architecture to expose the form and syntax of Japanese architecture—its modality—then utilise it to expose the idea of Japanese anti-space. The group act like machines to extract Japanese structures—abstract and tectonic—their physical forms effectuating the operation and acting as medium to communicate the output. The buildings operate in and not in the Japanese tradition—exactly they use Japanese construction in order to explicitly reject the object and to promote form.
	</p>

	<h1>Extra Not Extra</h1>
	<h2>Umbrella House</h2>
	<h2>1961</h2>


	<p>The Umbrella House activates the negation of pretext—making the object into an example. This negation of exteriority—of division from itself—makes the house original. Being original the object gets attached to the identity Shinohara and the identity Shinohara gets attached to the object. Like this the Umbrella House starts the war between Shinohara and the object—between identity and form.</p>

	<h1>The Logic of Emptiness</h1>
	<h2>The Japanese Conception of Space</h2>
	<h2>1964</h2>

	<p>The Werner Blaser 1955 publication Tempel und Teehaus made the tatami mat plan of Katsura Imperial Palace into the facsimile of the Miesian grid. The photography and the graphic design of the publication acting in synchrony to equivocate the two geometries. The Shinohara text The Japanese Conception Space published in 1964 in ja 39 negates any possibility to equivocate the Japanese timber frame to the modernist space frame. In the text Shinohara sets out the opposition—the unreal can not be like the real—to identically oppose the logic of emptiness to the medium of the grid. Basically Japanese architecture can not be imaged—imitated—letting it escape language.</p>

	<h1>Kitayama Cedar Post</h1>
	<h2>House in White</h2>
	<h2>1964</h2>

	<p>The House in White is used to perform abstraction—the negation of everything except the Kitayama cedar post—so that the act of not acting is performed with a type of violence. Language is radically negated and the post gets to represent itself in rude form. </p>

	<!-- <section id="second-style">
	<h1>Fissure</h1>
	<h2>Second Style</h2>
	<h2>1986–73</h2>

	<p>The five projects included in the second style all produce a big space that is in the mode [not style] of the shinden-shoin style. The extra space—stripped of symbolism—negates the image of Japanese tradition and by default can not imitate the Japanese shoin—exactly it reproduces it. Shinohara constructs performativity—the dialectical mode—in concrete form. Collectively the projects demonstrate the gap—interspace—between method and object ergo between idea and logos. Exactly the form is the function and the model of interspace. Like this the houses all work to show that system is type.</p>

	<h1>Title of text</h1>
	<h2>Uncompleted House</h2>
	<h2>1970</h2>

	<p>The exposition of anti–Japanese space is produced via the transposal of the cube to the interior—in the indivisibility of the cube. </p>

	<h1>Title of text</h1>
	<h2>Sea Stairway </h2>
	<h2>1971</h2>

	<p>'I stood at the entrance of the storeroom at the east end of the atelier, and two words floated through my head: 'sea' and 'stairway.'
	<br><br>
	The cool neutrality opposes the superficial—the repetition does not multiply in number—it resets back to the big space. The big space, like the shoin, is resistant to systematisation into any single type and the abstract machine shows its smoothness.</p>

	<h1>Earth to Air</h1>
	<h2>Tanikawa House </h2>
	<h2>1974</h2>

	<p>Radical simplification is made into exactly what it is. The practical function is non-existent so that the pretext—the negation of substitution—is exposed. The physical division of space now has no visible form—identically to the poetry of Shuntaro Tanikawa the object is hyper–literal. The antinomical nomenclature of the space machine [space being non-existent in Japan] is identically a machine that produces material emptiness.</p>

	<h1>Naked Reality</h1>
	<h2>When Naked Space is Traversed</h2>
	<h2>1976</h2>

	<p>Japanese temporality is post and pre modern—the temporal flux making it possible for technological modernism and ancient Japan to coexist—activating the singularity machine. Félix Guattari made multiple visits to 1980's Japan noting that 'The Japanese structure their universe and order their emotions within the proliferation and disorder of machines...they are crazy for machines, for a machinic kind of buzz’</p>

	<h1>Flatness and Repetition </h1>
	<h2>House in Ashitaka</h2>
	<h2>1977</h2>

	<p>The interior exposes the production of the big space in the flatness of division.

	<h1>I Want to Drink a Cup of Coffee. Because I want to.</h1>
	<h2>The Third Style</h2> 
	<h2>1977</h2>

	<p>The text, in three parts, documents the trip Shinohara made to West Africa in 1976 and starts the use of the savage nomenclature he lifts from Claude Levi–Strauss. In it Shinohara goes back to the First, Second, and Third Style logics and gets to the reality that he is is still in 'all–out war' between 'abstraction and concreteness.'</p>

	<h1>Naked Forms</h1>

	<p>The city...is replaced by the space of Africa composed only of the traces of its humanity.</p>

	<h1>Dynamic Ambivalence</h1>

	<p>The creation of any style will axiomatically encompass any force that is opposed to it and the result is the consequence of the struggle to resolve that opposition. At the moment of transformation, no cool logical calculation takes over...a moment in which transformation becomes virtual self-destruction, a moment when the very equilibrium between love and hate crumbles.</p>

	<h1>Savage and Concrete</h1>

	<p>“I want to drink a cup of coffee.” I asked him why. He answered, “Because I want to.” </p>
