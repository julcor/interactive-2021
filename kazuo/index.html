	The atypical projects make use of Japanese architecture to expose the form and syntax of Japanese architecture—its modality—then utilise it to expose the idea of Japanese anti-space. The group act like machines to extract Japanese structures—abstract and tectonic—their physical forms effectuating the operation and acting as medium to communicate the output. The buildings operate in and not in the Japanese tradition—exactly they use Japanese construction in order to explicitly reject the object and to promote form.

		Umbrella House<br>
		1961
	</h2>
	
	<h2 class="opener"></h2>
	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
			<h1>Extra</h1>
			<h1>Not</h1>
			<h1>Extra</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
	


	<p>The Umbrella House activates the negation of pretext—making the object into an example. This negation of exteriority—of division from itself—makes the house original. Being original the object gets attached to the identity Shinohara and the identity Shinohara gets attached to the object. Like this the Umbrella House starts the war between Shinohara and the object—between identity and form.</p>


	<h2>
		The Japanese Conception of Space<br>
		1964
	</h2>
	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
			<h1>The </h1>
			<h1>Logic </h1>
			<h1>of </h1>
			<h1>Emptiness</h1>
		</div>
	</div>


	<p>The Werner Blaser 1955 publication Tempel und Teehaus made the tatami mat plan of Katsura Imperial Palace into the facsimile of the Miesian grid. The photography and the graphic design of the publication acting in synchrony to equivocate the two geometries. The Shinohara text The Japanese Conception Space published in 1964 in ja 39 negates any possibility to equivocate the Japanese timber frame to the modernist space frame. In the text Shinohara sets out the opposition—the unreal can not be like the real—to identically oppose the logic of emptiness to the medium of the grid. Basically Japanese architecture can not be imaged—imitated—letting it escape language.</p>

	<h2>
		House in White<br>
		1964
	</h2>

	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
			<h1>Kitayama </h1>
			<h1>Cedar </h1>
			<h1>Post</h1>
		</div>
	</div>


	<p>The House in White is used to perform abstraction—the negation of everything except the Kitayama cedar post—so that the act of not acting is performed with a type of violence. Language is radically negated and the post gets to represent itself in rude form. </p>

	<h2 class="opener">Second Style<br>1968–74</h2>
	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
			<h1 class="opener">Dry </h1>

		</div>
	</div>
	

	<p class="opener">The five projects included in the second style all produce a big space that is in the mode [not style] of the shinden-shoin style. The extra space—stripped of symbolism—negates the image of Japanese tradition and by default can not imitate the Japanese shoin—exactly it reproduces it. Shinohara constructs performativity—the dialectical mode—in concrete form. Collectively the projects demonstrate the gap—interspace—between method and object ergo between idea and logos. Exactly the form is the function and the model of interspace. Like this the houses all work to show that system is type.</p>

	<h2>Uncompleted House<br>1970</h2>

	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
			<h1>Empty </h1>
			<h1>Language</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
	

	<p>The exposition of anti–Japanese space is produced via the transposal of the cube to the interior—in the indivisibility of the cube. </p>

	<h2>1971</h2>
	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">	
			<h1>Sea </h1>
			<h1>Stairway </h1>
		</div>
	</div>


	<p>'I stood at the entrance of the storeroom at the east end of the atelier, and two words floated through my head: 'sea' and 'stairway.'
	<br><br>
	The cool neutrality opposes the superficial—the repetition does not multiply in number—it resets back to the big space. The big space, like the shoin, is resistant to systematisation into any single type and the abstract machine shows its smoothness.</p>

	<h2>Tanikawa House <br> 1972–4</h2>

	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
			<h1>Hyper </h1>
			<h1>Literal </h1>
			<h1>Machine</h1>
		</div>
	</div>


	<p>Radical simplification is made into exactly what it is. The practical function is non-existent so that the pretext—the negation of substitution—is exposed. The physical division of space now has no visible form—identically to the poetry of Shuntaro Tanikawa the object is hyper–literal. The antinomical nomenclature of the space machine [space being non-existent in Japan] is identically a machine that produces material emptiness.</p>

	<h2>When Naked Space is Traversed<br>1976</h2>

	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
			<h1>Naked </h1>
			<h1>Reality</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
	

	<p>Japanese temporality is post and pre modern—the temporal flux making it possible for technological modernism and ancient Japan to coexist—activating the singularity machine. Félix Guattari made multiple visits to 1980's Japan noting that 'The Japanese structure their universe and order their emotions within the proliferation and disorder of machines...they are crazy for machines, for a machinic kind of buzz’</p>

	<h2>House in Ashitaka<br>1977</h2>

	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
	<h1>Flatness </h1>
	<h1>and </h1>
	<h1>Repetition </h1>
	</div>
</div>

	<p>The interior exposes the production of the big space in the flatness of division.

	<section id="third-style">
	<h2 class="opener">
		The Third Style<br>
		1977
	</h2> 
	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
	<h1 class="opener">I Want to Drink a Cup of Coffee. Because I want to.</h1>
</div>
</div>
	

	<p class="opener">The text, in three parts, documents the trip Shinohara made to West Africa in 1976 and starts the use of the savage nomenclature he lifts from Claude Levi–Strauss. In it Shinohara goes back to the First, Second, and Third Style logics and gets to the reality that he is is still in 'all–out war' between 'abstraction and concreteness.'</p>

	<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
	<h1>Naked Forms</h1>
	</div>
</div>

	<p>The city...is replaced by the space of Africa composed only of the traces of its humanity.</p>

<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
	<h1>Dynamic Ambivalence</h1>
	</div>
</div>

	<p>The creation of any style will axiomatically encompass any force that is opposed to it and the result is the consequence of the struggle to resolve that opposition. At the moment of transformation, no cool logical calculation takes over...a moment in which transformation becomes virtual self-destruction, a moment when the very equilibrium between love and hate crumbles.</p>

<div class="title-flex">
		<div class="wrapper">
	<h1>Savage and Concrete</h1>
</div>
</div>

	<p>“I want to drink a cup of coffee.” I asked him why. He answered, “Because I want to.” </p>
