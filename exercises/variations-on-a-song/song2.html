Are you talking yet<br>
But being isn't certain<br>
Any compliment he gives, it's under<br>
<br>
<!-- instrumental  -->
It is on the bridges<br>
Get away<br>
Soon to go away<br>
It is on the bridges<br>
It is on the bridges<br>

<!-- gets louder -->
It is on the bridges<br>
They were by the rail<br>
<!-- rail echoes -->
It is on the bridges<br>
Get away, save the window<br>
But you are seeing in<br>
<br>

<!-- instrumental -->
Where it goes to<br>
Being standard<br>
Always last place<br>
<!-- longer pause -->
And it shows up<br>
Any railcar<br>
Tender with her<br>
And it's being it<br>
<br>
<!-- silence and falls apart in a way, gets reallly loud-->
It is on the bridges<br>
<!-- bridges echoes -->
It is only being<br>
<!-- noises -->
