	Long time listener, First time caller is being printed signature by signature, weekly from February 1st until April 21st, culminating in a “thesis book”.
	<br><br>
	Long time listener, First time caller’s content is free-associative and improvised, each signature takes a previous project as its point of departure. The book encourages participation from readers through the form of comments and submitted content. It favors messy conversations and questions over neat conclusions.
	<br><br>
	Everything about the book can change next week.
